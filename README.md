R&D Spending Analysis
This project analyzes Research and Development (R&D) spending data for companies in the Health Care sector. It includes five key analyses:

Analysis 1: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
In this initial analysis, we load and preprocess the raw data to prepare it for further analysis.
We normalize column names, filter relevant columns, and ensure that the dataset is ready for exploration.

--------------------------------
Code
-----
The Python code for data preprocessing and cleaning can be found in data_preprocessing.py.

--------------------
Analysis 2: Total R&D Spending By Company In Health Care Sector Over 4 Years
This analysis focuses on visualizing the total R&D spending by individual companies in the Health Care sector over a 4-year period.
We use a treemap visualization to display the distribution of R&D spending among companies.
Code and Visualization
The Python code for this analysis can be found in analysis_2.py.
The main visualization is a treemap that provides insights into R&D spending trends within the Health Care sector.
---------------------------------------------

Analysis 3:

Health Care vs. IT R&D Spending Comparison in Year 1
In this analysis, we compare R&D spending between the Health Care and Information Technology (IT) sectors for Year 1.
We perform a statistical t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in R&D spending distributions between these sectors.
Code and Visualization
The Python code for this analysis can be found in analysis_3.py.
The key visualization is a bar chart comparing mean R&D spending between the Health Care and IT sectors in Year 1.
------------------------------------------------
Analysis 4: 

Total R&D Spending Change Across Health Care Companies
This analysis focuses on understanding the aggregated yearly spending changes across Health Care companies.
We calculate spending changes, round off the values, and visualize the data to identify trends.
Code and Visualization
The Python code for this analysis can be found in analysis_4.py.
The primary visualization is a line chart showing the changes in R&D spending over the years.
----------------------------------------
Analysis 5:

 Total R&D Spending By Company In Health Care Sector in 4 Years
In this analysis, we aim to visualize the total R&D spending by Health Care companies over a 4-year period.
We use a treemap to represent the distribution of spending among companies over these years.
Code and Visualization
The Python code for this analysis can be found in analysis_5.py.
The main visualization is a treemap that offers a comprehensive view of R&D spending trends over the 4-year period.
Usage
You can use the provided Python code to replicate these analyses with your own dataset.
Make sure to install the required libraries using pip install pandas matplotlib plotly scipy.
